# Framebuffer

A work-in-progress Elixir NIF for interacting with Linux framebuffers. If possible,
this will be a no-dependency library (apart from compilation build tools). This
library only supports compilation on Linux.

## Installation

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:framebuffer, github: "livinginthepast/framebuffer"}
  ]
end
```
